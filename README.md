#Pokemon Xp Calculator
This is a calculator for the core series pokemon games,
in particular Sword and Shield.

Only the current 400 pokemon in Sword and Shield are 
featured in this calculator.

## How to Use
Head to the [GitPage](https://github.com/cazaman11/PokemonXpCalculator)

Select a Pokemon from either name search or dex number
and set it's current level and then the target level 
you want to reach.

The calculator will determine the total xp and the 
amount of candies in either of 2 modes.

### General Mode
When the check is unticked the candy equals the amount
needed for that size candy to reach the target level.
E.g 8 small candy OR 2 medium to reach level 18 from 0

You will most likely go over the target level if you use
a larger candy, but is a guage on if you just want to get
there.

### Exact Mode
When checked that is the exact quanity of candies to get
to that level without wasting candy. 1 xs candy is always
included to ensure you reach the target.

## Feature request and Repost
I am open to further features of this calculator and will 
most likely update this. Leave a request or comment for 
particular features you would like to see.

Reposts of this are fine by me but ensure that it I am
creditied with links and notified of where the repost is.
