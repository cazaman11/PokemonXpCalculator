# Pokemon Xp Calculator
This is a calculator for the core series pokemon games,
in particular Sword and Shield.

All current 890 Pokemon are featured in this calculator for new additions
to Sword and Shield, as well for possible future games that feature xp candy.

## How to Use
Head to the [GitPage](https://cazaman11.github.io/PokemonXpCalculator/)

Select a Pokemon from either name search or dex number
and set it's current level and then the target level 
you want to reach.

The calculator will determine the total xp and the 
amount of candies in either of 2 modes.

### General Mode
When the check is unticked the candy equals the amount
needed for that size candy to reach the target level.
E.g 8 small candy OR 2 medium to reach level 18 from 0

You will most likely go over the target level if you use
a larger candy, but is a guage on if you just want to get
there.

### Exact Mode
When checked that is the exact quanity of candies to get
to that level without wasting candy.

### Size Toggle
Now you can click/tap on a sized candy to not include, in
exact mode it will automatically calculate down how much
of the smaller sized candy it requires. Select the candy
again to enable it.
